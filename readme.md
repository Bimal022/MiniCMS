# 🔧 MiniCMS

**MiniCMS** is a lightweight, browser-based content management system (CMS) built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with no backend dependencies. It allows you to create, edit, preview, and manage web pages using a simple component-based builder — all stored in your browser via `localStorage`.
